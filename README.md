# Blinkit Sales Dashboard
The Blinkit Sales Dashboard is an Excel-based interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of Blinkitâ€™s retail performance across multiple dimensions.

## Project Objective
The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders answer questions like:
   1). Which outlets (by size, location, establishment year, or type) are performing best?
   2).What are the top-selling product categories?
   3.) How do product attributes like fat content impact sales?
   4.)How many items are being sold, what are average sales, and what is the average rating?
